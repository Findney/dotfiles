We can't use like Picom to blur apps in GNOME. 
But, we can blur apps alternatively use GNOME extension 
called Blur my Shell. 
 - Name: Blur my Shell
 - Link: https://github.com/aunetx/blur-my-shell

My Configuration for application setting in Blur my Shell:
 - first we need to turn on Window list extension blur feature
 - after that, turn on Application blur feature
 - then, turn on custom properties with configuration:
             - sigma : 18
             - brightness : 0.84
 - the next, set opacity to 200
 - and the last one, add window you want to blur in whitelist feature
